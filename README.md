The Messages Attachment Manager is a Mac application that allows you to select and delete the attachments that you have sent and received from people in the Messages application. This is only for people that use Messages (iMessage) on their Mac, if you haven't linked Messages up to your iCloud account then you won't have all of the files on your computer.


### _Credits_


I would like to give credit to Ray Wenderlich for the [SlidesMagic](https://www.raywenderlich.com/120494/collection-views-os-x-tutorial) tutorial that I used for the backbone of the UI of the app. In addition I used Stephen Celis' [SQLite.swift](https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift) project for SQL calls to the database. Both of their licenses are present within the project.
