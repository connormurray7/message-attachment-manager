 As described below, credit is given to Gabriel Miro for the MVC template in the SlidesMagic template
 And credit is given to Stephen Celis for the SQLite swift framework.
 
 I made some major adjustments to the software which are outlined in the README, but I generally 
 used the template that was provided from Gabriel
